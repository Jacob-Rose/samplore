# Samplore JUCE - Todo List


Major TODOs:
[ ] (P0) Make tag for mobirise site in git history, then migrate to a github site with feature breakdown.
[ ] (P1) Add Active player in bottom right under the tags.
[ ] (P1) Add general import and manual import options
    - Centralized Repository Import options

[ ] (P1) Add packs view (replace directory breakdown)
    - make splice pack name clearer on the directory breakdown. Give directories nicknames.
[ ] (P1) Store all our internal data in .db files in respective directories.

Features:



In no real order from there, but with prio:
[ ] (P3) Add MIDI Cue Point System (maybe VST support makes sense here too as alternative)
    [ ] (P3) hold 1 second to set at the current point, 3 seconds to remove cue for any key, handle key event. Save, Load, and Reset the cue points bound to buttons, but the actual cue points are saved to the sample
    [ ] (P3) Add Exit Warning Generalized System
        - We might have various modules that all have different closing logic and messages they want to send to the user on close.
        ◦ All Cue Points will be unbound, are you sure you want to quit? For V1
[ ] (P2) Some form of tag extraction
    [ ] (P2) BPM Extraction if relevant
    [ ] (P2) Key Extraction (are we gonna fft ourselves?)
[ ] (P2) Add Cue Playback experiment zone. Ability to quick try, modify, and cache vst stacks.
    [ ] (P2) Cue bindings can assign a "cue stack" they are registered to. this will also act as a choke for multiplay.
    [ ] (P3) Audio Playback Speed (With Key preserve and raw resample)
    [ ] (P3) Filters (a few stock ones)
        [ ] If we use vsts, we can use the stock preset open source ones for eq and all the common core ones.
    [ ] (P4) VST Support for Sample Processing (can a vst use other vsts? / maybe only do in non-vst mode.)
[ ] (P3) Add Extended Sample Editor, with advanced editing of cue points, view all tags, ect. 
    [ ] (P3) Possibly take up space with the audioplayer, take over the main sample selection menu, but the selected sample in the extended editor does not need to be the one that was just playing
[ ] (P1) Add Active Audio Player Box with controls like stop, time bar. make it optional
[ ] (P1) Make Sample title scroll or reveal itself in some fashion when shortened.
[ ] (P2) Add tutorial / intro overlay guided experience.
    [ ] Make generalized named component binding system so we can generically reference hyper-specific components for tutorial or really any advanced changed ui action.
    [ ] Add ability to redo tutorial in info tab
