# Samplore JUCE - Todo List


Major Blockers:
[ ] (P0) Make tag for mobirise site in git history, then migrate to a github site with feature breakdown.

Bugs:
[ ] (P2) Custom Color Caching has some ai sloppiness to it. Whole theme manager needs to be event based over this garbage.
[ ] (P1) Reduce AI Slop (and 5+ year code rot)

Fixins:
[ ] (P1) Add + Remove directories should be done from preferences.

Features:

In no real order from there, but with prio:
[ ] (P1) Generalized Keybind + Remapping System (also breadcrumbs controls)
[ ] (P1) Create Intro Card
    [ ] - Explain Left + Right Click Better to user until tutorial can explain.
[ ] (P3) Add MIDI Cue Point System (maybe VST support makes sense here too as alternative)
    [ ] (P3) hold 1 second to set at the current point, 3 seconds to remove cue for any key, handle key event. Save, Load, and Reset the cue points bound to buttons, but the actual cue points are saved to the sample
    [ ] (P3) Add Exit Warning Generalized System
        - We might have various modules that all have different closing logic and messages they want to send to the user on close.
        ◦ All Cue Points will be unbound, are you sure you want to quit? For V1
    [ ] (P3) Drum Rack mode with multiple keyboard bindings, 
[ ] (P2) Some form of tag extraction
    [ ] (P2) BPM Extraction if relevant
    [ ] (P2) Key Extraction (are we gonna fft ourselves?)
[ ] (P2) Add sample experiment zoone. Ability to quick try and modify.
    [ ] (P3) Audio Playback Speed (With Key preserve and raw resample)
    [ ] (P3) Filters (a few stock ones)
        [ ] If we use vsts, we can use the stock preset open source ones for eq and all the common core ones.
    [ ] (P4) VST Support for Sample Processing (can a vst use other vsts? / maybe only do in non-vst mode.)
[ ] (P3) Add Extended Sample Editor, with advanced editing of cue points, view all tags, ect. 
    [ ] (P3) Possibly take up space with the audioplayer, take over the main sample selection menu, but the selected sample in the extended editor does not need to be the one that was just playing
[ ] (P1) Add Active Audio Player Box with controls like stop, time bar. make it optional
[ ] (P1) Make Sample title scroll or reveal itself in some fashion when shortened.
[ ] (P2) Add tutorial / intro overlay guided experience.
    [ ] Make generalized named component binding system so we can generically reference hyper-specific components for tutorial or really any advanced changed ui action.
    [ ] Add ability to redo tutorial in info tab
[ ] (P1) Add Active player in bottom right under the tags.
